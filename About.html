         My name is Carl Harrisson and I'm a product designer currently based in London, originally from Stockholm, Sweden. I'm currently in my second year of a BA (Hons) in Product Design at Ravensbourne University, and I'm excited to share my design portfolio with you!
          <p>
            As a creative individual, I've always been drawn to expressing myself through my work. Design has always been a passion of mine, and I believe that good design has the power to improve people's lives. I'm particularly interested in the finance industry, and I hope to work with banks to design solutions that solve problems in people's daily lives.
            <p>
              When I'm not designing, you can usually find me on the slopes skiing, exploring new places while travelling, or hanging out with friends. 
              <p>
                Through my portfolio, I hope to share my creative process and design thinking with you.
